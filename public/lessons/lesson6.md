# Lesson 6: Dissolved Oxygen — Life’s Currency

Aquatic animals breathe oxygen dissolved in water; without it, rivers “go septic”.

### Controls on DO
1. **Solubility** (physical): higher at low temperature and low salinity.  
2. **Photosynthesis & respiration** (biological): algae add O₂ by day, consume it at night.  
3. **Re‑aeration** (hydraulic): turbulence forces atmospheric O₂ into water.

Healthy UK salmonid streams need **>7 mg L⁻¹** (≈ 70 % saturation).

### Sensing technology
| Method | Principle | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Clark electrode | O₂ diffuses through membrane, consumes cathode current | Cheap, but flow‑dependent, requires stirring |
| Optical (luminescent) | O₂ quenches dye fluorescence; decay time ∝ O₂ | Low drift, no stirring, higher cost |

### Diurnal signature
DO often peaks at late afternoon (photosynthesis) and troughs just before dawn (respiration). Continuous sensors reveal this swing; grab samples miss it.

### Management link
Urban rivers with high BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) may drop below 4 mg L⁻¹ overnight. Installing an **aeration cascade** raised nighttime DO by 3 mg L⁻¹ and eliminated fish distress events within weeks.

Why does DO saturation fall when temperature rises?
