# Lesson 5: pH, Alkalinity and Acid Stress

pH tells you the balance between hydrogen (H⁺) and hydroxide (OH⁻) ions. UK freshwaters mostly lie between 6.5 and 8.5, but peat uplands and mine drainage can push extremes.

### The chemistry
pH = −log₁₀[H⁺]. A drop of one unit means **10×** more acidity.  
*Alkalinity* (mg CaCO₃ L⁻¹) is the water’s buffering capacity — mainly bicarbonate ions that neutralise acid inputs.

### Ecological thresholds
| pH | Effect |
|----|--------|
| < 5.5 | Invertebrate diversity collapses |
| < 5.0 | Many fish eggs fail to hatch |
| > 9.5 | Ammonia toxicity rises |

### Sensor design
The classic **glass electrode** develops a millivolt potential proportional to pH (≈59 mV per unit at 25 °C). A reference cell completes the circuit.  
*Care*: keep hydrated, calibrate daily with pH 7 and pH 4/10 buffers. Optical ISFET probes are tougher but pricier.

### Intervention example
Forestry on Welsh uplands once drove stream pH down to 4. Forestry England trialled **liming** (adding crushed limestone). Sensors showed pH rising to 6.2 within hours and young salmon returning within a season.

**Quick check**  
If a stream’s pH shifts from 7.2 to 6.2 during heavy rain, how many times more acidic has it become?
