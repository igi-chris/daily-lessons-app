# LessonÂ 22: The Future of Inâ€‘Situ Water Monitoring

### Trends
* **Lowâ€‘cost IoT boards** (ESP32) + robust MEMS sensors â€” citizen science boom.  
* **Labâ€‘onâ€‘chip** analysers (microfluidic) for metals and DNA.  
* **Machine learning** flagging anomalies and predicting pollution events.  
* **Satellite + inâ€‘situ fusion**: Sentinelâ€‘2 chlorophyll maps validated by buoy sensors.

### Skillset for the next decade
Data literacy, coding (Python/R), basic electronics, and ecological context.

### Takeâ€‘home message
Sensors provide continuous evidence, but turning numbers into river stewardship depends on inquisitive humans â€” like you.

**Final challenge**  
Set yourself a miniâ€‘project: e.g. log temperature in a local stream for a month and share findings with the community.

Congratulations on finishing the course! ðŸŽ‰
