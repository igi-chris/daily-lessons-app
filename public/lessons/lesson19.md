# Lesson 19: Hydromorphology and Habitat Metrics

Beyond chemistry, sensors aid habitat assessment.

### Velocity & depth arrays
Acoustic Doppler Profiler maps full cross‑section velocity: helps set environmental flow requirements.

### Temperature mosaics
Distributed 1‑Wire strings reveal cold‑water refugia (springs) vital for trout during heatwaves.

### Substrate movement
Smart Pebbles with accelerometers log gravels’ motion during floods (sediment budget studies).

Putting physical habitat data next to water quality forms a holistic river health picture.
