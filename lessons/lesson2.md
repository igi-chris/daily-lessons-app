# Lesson 2: From Raincloud to River — The Hydrological Setting

Understanding sensors is easier when you picture **where** the water has come from and **where** it is going.

### Catchments and pathways
A **catchment** (drainage basin) is the land area that funnels rainfall into a particular water body.  
Water follows four main pathways:

| Pathway | Timescale | Sensor signal it influences |
|---------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Direct runoff | minutes–hours | Sudden rise in **level** and **turbidity** |
| Through‑flow (soil) | hours–days | Moderate rise, cooler **temperature** |
| Groundwater | weeks–years | Stable **temperature**, may raise **conductivity** |
| Evapotranspiration | hours–days | Lowers **level** in dry spells |

### UK example: River Torridge headwaters  
Heavy rain on Exmoor produces a **flashy** hydrograph: level can jump 1 m in two hours, carrying brown, sediment‑laden water. An in‑river turbidity probe captures the spike that grab samples nearly always miss.

### Why context matters for sensors
* Site selection: place a level logger where the rating curve (stage → discharge) is stable, not in a back‑eddy.  
* Interpreting data: a sudden pH dip at dawn may be a sensor fault… or an algal respiration signal. Knowing the catchment biology helps you decide.

**Quiz**  
1. Which flow pathway responds fastest to rainfall?  
2. Give one catchment feature that could cause persistently high conductivity.
