# Lesson 20: Communicating Results to Stakeholders

Data alone rarely changes behaviour; clear communication does.

### Visual tools
* **Sparkline texts** on social media during floods.  
* **Story maps** combining GIS layers and sensor plots for council reports.  
* **QR codes** on footpath signs link to live gauge dashboards (River Nidd project).

### Language matters
“DO 4 mg L⁻¹” → “Oxygen dangerously low for fish”.  
Avoid jargon; use analogies (turbidity like “driving in fog”).

### Success story
Citizen group in Sheffield used live turbidity alerts to time street‑sweeping before rain, cutting sediment pulses by 50 %.
