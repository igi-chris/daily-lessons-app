# Lesson 10: Chlorophyll‑a and Algal Blooms

Chlorophyll‑a fluorescence gives a rapid proxy for algal biomass.

---

### Sensor principle
Blue light excites chlorophyll; emitted red fluorescence is proportional to concentration (µg L⁻¹). Correct for turbidity and ambient light.

### When and why
Summer + nutrients + slow flow ⇒ algal bloom. Blooms drive pH up (photosynthetic CO₂ uptake) by day and DO down by night (respiration). Some cyanobacteria release toxins (microcystin).

### UK case
Rutland Water reservoir recorded chlorophyll > 80 µg L⁻¹ in July 2022. Managers closed recreation areas and dosed hydrogen peroxide selectively; sensors confirmed recovery to < 10 µg L⁻¹ within a week.

**Quiz**  
Explain how chlorophyll, pH and dissolved oxygen sensors together diagnose eutrophication.
