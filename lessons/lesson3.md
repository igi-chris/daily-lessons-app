# Lesson 3: Temperature — The Master Variable

Water **temperature** controls reaction rates, gas solubility and organism metabolism. A single thermometer can explain a surprising amount of ecological change.

### Science in 90 seconds
*Density*: water is densest at **4 °C**. Thermal stratification in lakes traps cold, oxygen‑poor water at depth.  
*Gas solubility*: every 10 °C rise roughly halves dissolved oxygen (DO) saturation.  
*Biology*: biochemical activity doubles for each 10 °C (the Q10 rule) until enzymes denature.

### Sensor technology
| Type | Principle | Pros / Cons |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Thermistor | Resistance ↓ as T ↑ | Cheap (<£10), ±0.1 °C, slight self‑heating |
| RTD (Pt100) | Linear resistance ↑ | Stable, ±0.05 °C, dearer |
| Digital IC (e.g. DS18B20) | On‑chip conversion | Direct serial output, ±0.5 °C |

Most multi‑parameter sondes embed a thermistor; level loggers incorporate a temperature channel for compensation.

### Field tips
* Shield sensors from direct sun to avoid radiant heating.  
* Record at least every 15 min to see diel (24 h) cycles.  
* Use temperature as a **quality‑control flag**: a sudden 25 °C jump in February probably indicates the probe is out of water.

Plot a summer week of river temperature and DO. Explain why DO troughs lag temperature peaks by ~4 h.
