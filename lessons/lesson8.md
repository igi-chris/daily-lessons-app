# Lesson 8: Nutrients — Nitrate, Phosphate and Eutrophication

Excess nutrients fuel algal blooms and deplete oxygen when the algae die.

### Chemistry refresher
* Nitrate (NO₃⁻) and phosphate (PO₄³⁻) are essential plant nutrients.  
* Sources: fertiliser runoff, sewage effluent, livestock manure.  
* In freshwaters, phosphate < 0.05 mg L⁻¹ and nitrate < 10 mg L⁻¹ are typical “good‑status” targets (Water Framework Directive).

### Sensor options
1. **UV absorbance** (200–220 nm): rapid, but organic matter interferes.  
2. **Ion‑selective electrode (ISE)**: low power, suitable for wells; requires ionic‑strength adjustment.  
3. **Wet‑chemistry analysers**: mini colorimeters mixing reagent on site; higher maintenance.

### Practical application
On the River Wensum, continuous UV nitrate sensors showed spikes after heavy rain on maize fields. Farmers trialled cover crops; nitrate pulses halved in the next season, confirmed by the sensors.

**Quiz**  
Why can high phosphorus sometimes have a delayed impact compared with nitrate?
