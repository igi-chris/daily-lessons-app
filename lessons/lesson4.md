# Lesson 4: Measuring Water Level and Flow

Flood forecasting, abstraction licensing and habitat studies all start with accurate stage (water level) data.

### Pressure transducers (contact)
A vented cable lets atmospheric pressure cancel out, so the sensor output (≈ 9.81 kPa per m) equals water column height.  
*Accuracy*: ±0.01 m typical.  
*Drift*: zero shift due to biofouling or vent blockage — clean vents monthly.

### Radar & ultrasonic (non‑contact)
Emit microwave or ultrasonic pulses from above the channel; time‑of‑flight gives distance to surface.  
*Advantages*: no fouling, ideal for flood flows or sewage weirs.  
*Limitations*: foam and wind chop scatter energy; ±0.02 m.

### Converting stage to discharge
Install a **staff gauge** for visual checks, then develop a **rating curve** (Q = a (h – h₀)^b).  
Traditional method: manual current‑meter gaugings at several levels.  
Modern option: acoustic Doppler stream‑proﬁlers record velocity–area during high flows to extend the curve.

### Environmental meaning
* Rising level + rising turbidity ⇒ surface runoff event  
* Falling level but rising conductivity ⇒ groundwater becoming dominant  
* Persistent low flows ⇒ habitat stress, triggers hands‑off abstraction rules

**Try this**  
Look up today’s gauge height at an EA Flood Monitoring station near you. Compare with the long‑term percentile — is the river unusually high or low?
