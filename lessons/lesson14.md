# Lesson 14: Biofouling and Anti‑Fouling Strategies

Biofilms, algae and sediment can mask sensors within days, giving false readings.

### Rates
Summer river biofilm can grow 1 mm day⁻¹. Turbidity probes over‑read; optical DO under‑read (O₂ diffusion barrier).

### Mitigation toolbox
* **Wipers** with nitrile blades sweep lenses every 30 min.  
* **Copper anti‑foul rings** deter biofilm.  
* **Chlorination** (ppm Cl₂) in marine deployments.  
* **Anti‑foul paint** for housings — avoid sensor windows!

Field servicing schedules often balance wiper use (battery load) vs visit interval. In a Scottish loch, monthly visits sufficed with wipers; without, accuracy failed by week 2.
