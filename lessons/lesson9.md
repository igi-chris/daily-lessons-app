# Lesson 9: Turbidity and Suspended Sediment

Turbidity is the optical clarity of water; high turbidity scatters light, harming photosynthesis and fish gills.

### Units
| Unit | Instrument | Comment |
|------|------------|---------|
| NTU (Nephelometric) | IR LED 90° scatter | Standard for drinking water |
| FNU (ISO 7027) | 860 nm IR | For environmental waters |
| mg L⁻¹ suspended solids | Lab gravimetric | Calibrate optical sensor |

### Sensor configuration
Place the probe in the thalweg (main current) but avoid bubbles. Wipers reduce biofouling. Calibrate monthly with formazin or polymer beads.

### Environmental meaning
* Road‑construction runoff can exceed **1000 NTU**.  
* Salmonid spawning fails above 25 NTU for weeks (clogged redds).  
* High turbidity correlates with **E. coli** (particle‑attached bacteria).

### Mitigation example
A silt fence on a housing site cut downstream turbidity peaks by 70 %; sensors proved compliance with the method statement.

**Exercise**  
Identify two natural causes and two human causes of high turbidity events.
