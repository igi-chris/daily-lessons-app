# Lesson 7: Electrical Conductivity and Salinity

Conductivity measures water’s ability to carry an electric current, directly related to ion concentration (µS cm⁻¹).

### Typical UK values
* Upland peat bogs: **<50**  
* Chalk streams: **500–800** (bicarbonate‑rich)  
* Estuary transition: rises sharply to **>10 000**

### Sensor mechanics
An **AC excitation** (typically 1 kHz) is applied across graphite or stainless electrodes; conductance is converted to specific conductivity at 25 °C using temperature compensation.

### Diagnostic power
* Sudden spike downstream of a road → de‑icing salt runoff  
* Summer rise in small streams → evapoconcentration  
* Falling cond. during storm → dilution by rainwater

### Linking to interventions
Installing reed‑bed treatment at a mine discharge cut conductivity from 2400 to 600 µS cm⁻¹; sensors verified compliance with the discharge permit.

**Mini‑exercise**  
Plot conductivity vs stage during a storm: explain the hysteresis (cond. lowest on rising limb, recovers on recession).
